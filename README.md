# stock-analysis

## Overview/Purpose of Project:
   * The purpose of this project was to help Steve analyze the stock market for his parents by providing/refactoring a VBA code/script that is clean, efficient and minimizes the time to run it in an excel workbook. Moreover, the code would enable his parents to analyze stocks from other years making the code even more useful. Below is a brief snapshot/summary of our results as we compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, and demonstrate the decrease in execution times of the refactored script when compared to the original script.
